Basically do a git clone of the repo, cd into the folder and run vagrant up. 
The host machine should be preferably a linux (I use an Ubuntu). 
The host machine should be running the latest version os ansible and virtualbox. 
If the machine is not powerfull enough, adjust the memory in the Vagrantfile.
